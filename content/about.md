I'm Eric Kramer, a data scientist and soon-to-be medical doctor. I'm an alumnus of Northwestern, UC San Diego School of Medicine and [Dataiku](http://dataiku.com). I'm interested in the intersection of medicine and data science, data visualization and machine learning.

This website has links to some of my data science projects and demos. Get in touch if you want to talk more about data science or medicine.
